                <h3 id="sekvens">Sequence for Submitting Messages (POST)</h3>
                <p>
                    Generally, the submission of information works such that the actor
                    sends a message (POST) and receives a reference
                    (requestId). By using the received reference, the actor
                    can query (GET) the result of the submission and upon success
                    receive a permanent reference to the message, issued by
                    Norwegian Customs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is done at a dedicated endpoint
                    (<code>/validation-status</code>) in the query API
                    linked further down on this page. These services are
                    asynchronous and therefore one must query until a
                    response is received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Validation responses are usually available within
                    1 to 2 seconds, but it may take longer in some cases. Querying is done
                    at the <code>/validation-status</code> endpoint, which will
                    return the MRN upon success and a list of validation errors
                    if any.<br/>
                    The permanent reference is called a Master Reference
                    Number, abbreviated MRN. MRN is used when messages need to
                    be updated or canceled (put/delete) to refer to
                    previously submitted messages.<br/>
                    The validation endpoint can also return a list of
                    document statuses to indicate missing information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recommended method for submission is that the actor submits all
                    messages for creation (POST) that are relevant, and then waits
                    1-2 seconds before querying for validation (query API).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: if you have 500 consignments for a
                    master consignment on a transport, you submit (POST)
                    all 500 consignment messages, wait a few seconds,
                    query for validation, and receive the MRN and status for all 500
                    messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you receive a 404 status when calling the validation endpoint, you
                    must wait a bit and query again. It is recommended to create an algorithm
                    that makes repeated attempts until a validation response is received.
                </p>

                <h3 id="valideringMeldinger">Validation Errors</h3>
                <p>
                    See <a href="synkrone-valideringsfeil-EN.html">this page</a> for
                    an overview of the most common validation errors you may encounter with
                    possible causes/corrections for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a consignment receives routing signals multiple times, the
                    <em>last</em> routing signal is the one that
                    applies. For example, it is possible for a
                    consignment to first
                    receive <strong>ENTRY_PENDING</strong> and then
                    receive <strong>TO_CONTROL</strong>. If a
                    consignment you have reported does not receive a
                    routing signal when expected, it usually means that
                    Norwegian Customs has not had sufficient time to
                    process the consignment message. The actor must then
                    hold back the consignments until a routing signal is
                    received for it.
                </p>


                <h3 id="kodeverk">Code Lists</h3>
                <p>
                    An overview of the various code lists that the
                    message content is validated against can be found
                    on <a href="mo-kodeverk-EN.html">a separate
                    page</a>. In the schemas on the APIs, it will be
                    indicated which code lists the data fields are
                    validated against.

                    In addition to the consignment information provided
                    through the movement APIs, invoices for consignments
                    where a customs declaration has already been
                    submitted can also be sent.  Documentation for this
                    API can be found here:

                    We have created a brief overview of how consignment
                    message content might look based on the customs
                    procedure used.

                    On the same page, there is information about test
                    data related to customs declarations that can be
                    used in connection with interface testing.
