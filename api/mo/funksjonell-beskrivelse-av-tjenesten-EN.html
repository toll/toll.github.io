            <p>
                The service aims to enable business actors to fulfill the notification
                and disclosure obligations digitally.
                Additionally, the service aims to automate the steps in the process as much as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conceptually, the part of the service described here
                is concerned with handling the submission of
                information in such a way that it ensures Norwegian
                Customs' needs for risk assessment and control while
                facilitating the automation of other steps.
            </p>

            <p>
                The service allows messages about consignments,
                master consignments, and transport to be submitted
                as early as possible and independently of each
                other. However, it is important to note that at the
                latest by border crossing, the entirety of the
                information submitted to Norwegian Customs must meet
                the requirements for notification and disclosure
                obligations.<br/> This means that the different
                information elements must be linked together, with
                keys provided by the submitters, and that the
                necessary references are in place where
                required.<br/> For other modes of transport than
                road vehicles, border crossing is considered to be
                when the means of transport arrives at its
                destination (e.g., airport, port, or railway
                terminal).
            </p>

            <p>
                The submitter of a message has the ability to
                submit a message early, update the message, and withdraw the message
                if necessary (post, put, delete).<br/>
                The submitter can request the status of the message (get).
            </p>

            <p>
                The submitter can submit messages until the
                transport arrives at the border. At border crossing,
                the information provided must be complete for the
                transport, its master consignments, and
                consignments.
            </p>

            <p>Information can be submitted at three levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transport, which contains
                    <ul>
                        <li>Master consignments, which contain
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consignments</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It is also possible to submit transport and
                consignments without submitting a master
                consignment. Transport is then linked to
                consignments.
