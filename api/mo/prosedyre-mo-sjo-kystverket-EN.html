        <h2 id="genereltOmDigitoll">General about Digitoll, Digital Notification and Information Obligation for Import of Goods to Norway</h2>

        <p>
            The operator of a means of transport will in the future be obliged to comply with the notification and information obligation digitally.
            This involves submitting digital information to Norwegian Customs about:
        </p>

        <ul class="spaced-list">
            <li>Means of transport</li>
            <li>Cargo aboard the means of transport</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Submission of transport information and information about cargo aboard is done separately. Different actors
            can take responsibility for submitting the different parts. Nevertheless, it is important to note that at the latest upon
            border crossing, the entirety of information submitted to Norwegian Customs must satisfy the requirements that
            apply to the notification and information obligation. For maritime transport mode, border crossing is considered to be when
            the means of transport arrives at its destination, i.e., the port where goods are to be unloaded, but the deadline for
            submission of messages is 24 hours before arrival, or at the latest upon departure from the previous port.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a requirement to provide reference information (the information elements must be linked together, with keys provided by
            the submitters, and that the necessary references are in place where required) in the messages so that Norwegian Customs can
            link submitted data about transport and cargo together, and process them as one.
        </p>

        <h2 id="SSNNbeskrivelse">Functional Description of the Service to SSNN</h2>

        <p>
            Since vessels today are obliged to use SSNN to report data to the public authorities in connection with port calls in Norway,
            the Norwegian Coastal Administration in collaboration with Norwegian Customs must develop support so that the new digital notification and information obligation can
            be complied with through use of SSNN. In addition to SSNN having to support that vessels can register mandatory
            information to Norwegian Customs in SSNN, a new important part of the service is that the Norwegian Coastal Administration shall forward
            information from SSNN to Norwegian Customs' internal systems for processing there (on par with other
            modes of transport). The result of the processing is communicated back to SSNN and made available to actors
            in the business community who have submitted data (ship master etc.).
        </p>

        <p>SSNN shall submit messages to Digitoll in the formats described here.</p>
        <p><strong>Information can be submitted at three levels from SSNN:</strong></p>

        <ul class="spaced-list">
            <li>
                Transport → Corresponds to "Visit" in SSNN → Information about the means of transport, which port it comes to and
                the time of the call
            </li>
            <li>
                Goods → "Description of goods" (DOG) → Information about goods that the transport carries. Master consignment
                and house consignment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Linking → "Relationship" → Linking information → Links transport with goods (master and house)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transport ("Visit")</h2>

        <p>
            SSNN shall send a transport message to Norwegian Customs for every single ship that is to have a port call in a Norwegian
            port and which is reported in SSNN.
            This corresponds to a "visit" in SSNN and is identified with a "visit-id".
        </p>

        <p>
            For a transport message (visit), what is the "port of call" (the place the vessel calls at) will always be specified.
        </p>

        <p>
            Norwegian Customs will validate and return an MRN in the query-status endpoint upon successful submission of
            transport message.
        </p>

        <h2>Goods ("DOG")</h2>
        <p>
            If the ship comes from abroad and transports goods to the Norwegian customs territory, the vessel's master shall report
            customs formalities in SSNN under the formality 'Declaration of Goods' (DOG).
        </p>

        <p>
            The actors can choose to deliver all customs formalities in SSNN, parts of these, or as a minimum that
            reference to customs formalities submitted directly to Norwegian Customs is reported in DOG in SSNN. In case only
            parts of the customs formalities, or references to customs formalities are delivered in SSNN, then the rest must be delivered
            directly to Norwegian Customs.
        </p>

        <p>
            All goods that are aboard the vessel upon arrival at a port shall be declared on a DOG.
            Port of discharge in DOG provides information about where to unload the goods.
        </p>

        <p>Norwegian Customs will validate and return an MRN in the query-status endpoint upon successful submission of each
            DOG.</p>

        <h2>Linking ("Relationship")</h2>

        <p>
            To link customs formalities submitted in SSNN to the actual port call ("visit"), a
            linking message ("relationship") shall be sent.
            The linking message contains reference to transport ("visit-id" for a port call) and reference to
            the transport document specified/referred to in DOG (id for goods, master or house).
            Transport will always occur in SSNN, while information about goods (master/house) can occur in SSNN or in
            Digitoll.
        </p>

        <p>
            All goods that are aboard the vessel upon arrival at a port (through all DOG messages) must be linked to
            the port call (visit), regardless of whether they are to be unloaded in the current port or whether they are to be unloaded in a
            subsequent port.
        </p>

        <p>
            Norwegian Customs will validate and return an MRN in the query-status endpoint upon successful submission of
            relationship message.
        </p>

        <h2>Information about All Goods Shall Be Delivered Before the First Port Call</h2>
        <p>
            If a vessel is to unload goods from abroad in multiple ports, then information about all goods aboard
            shall be delivered before the first port call.
            In the subsequent port calls, one does not need to fill out information about goods anew in SSNN. It is sufficient to provide
            the transport document number references to already submitted DOG messages in connection with the first port call.
        </p>

        <h2>Transitional Arrangement in Connection with New Digital Notification and Information Obligation</h2>
        <p>
            Today's solution in current SSNN is that the vessel's master uploads manifests as documentation of which goods
            are aboard. With new SSNN, it is described above how the new solution will be. However, there must be a
            transitional arrangement where the vessel's master is not forced to use the new solution. It must be possible in new SSNN to upload
            manifests in a transitional period. Ref. below about old and new solutions in parallel, these manifests must be
            available to Norwegian Customs in current SSNN for manual lookup.
        </p>

        <p>
            In such cases, a transport message is sent from SSNN to Norwegian Customs regarding the port call, no DOG data,
            no relationship message.
        </p>

        <h2>Crew Declarations (crew effects) and Provisions Aboard (ship store)</h2>

        <p>
            Vessels arriving in Norway have, in addition to the obligation to inform about what goods they transport, also an obligation to
            report any crew declarations and provisions aboard. Norwegian Customs plans to digitize these
            obligations in a phase 2 of adapting new SSNN for Norwegian Customs' needs.
        </p>

        <p><strong>In the interim period, the following will apply:</strong></p>

        <ul class="spaced-list">
            <li>
                Crew declarations are reported in the new submission interface in SSNN, the data is converted to JSON-formated text file in
                SSNN and sent back to the current version of SSNN, and displayed there in connection with port calls (corresponding
                to what is shown today by uploading JSON-formated text file about this information)
            </li>
            <li>
                Provisions are reported structured in new SSNN in the same way as was done in existing. The data
                is converted back to current SSNN and displayed there as today
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In the long term, Norwegian Customs will develop interfaces so that information about crew declarations and provisions can
            be transmitted and processed in Norwegian Customs' systems (following the same pattern as for DOG ref above)
        </p>

        <h2>Notification and Information Obligation for Export of Goods from Norway</h2>

        <p>
            Norwegian Customs has not conducted a digitization process in connection with export of goods from Norway. Today's
            solution in SSNN is continued if it is in the new solution. This means that the vessel's master (or their representative) must
            be able to upload manifests as files in SSNN to describe the cargo being exported. This data will not be
            transmitted to Norwegian Customs. Norwegian Customs will have access to the data by logging into SSNN and retrieving
            manifest information on specific vessel departures (as today)
        </p>

        <p>
            There are no customs formalities related to movement of already cleared goods within Norway
            (domestic).
        </p>

        <h2>Old and New SSNN</h2>
        <p>
            In a transitional phase, the Norwegian Coastal Administration will move data reported in new SSNN back to old SSNN and display it there as
            today. Norwegian Customs will be able to use old SSNN to log in and have insight into the same information about vessels
            arriving in Norway as today, even though parts of the data are submitted in the new solution.
        </p>
