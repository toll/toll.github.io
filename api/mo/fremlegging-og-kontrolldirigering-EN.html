            <h1 id="kontrolldir">Presentation and Control Routing</h1>
            <p>
                Presentation and control routing consist of two APIs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Presentation (movement-presentation-api)</li>
                <li>Control Routing (movement-routing-api)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Both APIs are covered by the
                scope <strong><code>toll:movement/entry</code></strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Norwegian Customs will attempt to automatically
                detect the arrival of transport at the border
                crossing. If automatic arrival is detected,
                Norwegian Customs will perform an automatic digital
                presentation of all expected consignments on the
                arriving transport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Norwegian Customs will then make routing available
                in our API for the expected consignments. Actors
                connected to the presented consignments will be able
                to retrieve control routing via the API
                (movement-routing-api).
            </p>
            <p>
                The actors automatically connected in this way are
                the actor who submitted information about the
                consignment in Norwegian Customs' API (authenticated
                in Maskinporten) and any customs representative
                mentioned in the consignment, master consignment, or
                transport message.
            </p>

            <p>
                The control routing API works by continuously
                publishing routing signals for presented
                consignments. Usually, the presentation will occur
                automatically upon the arrival of the transport
                vehicle, but it can also be triggered by a call to
                the presentation API (movement-presentation-api).
            </p>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li>
                    Each call to the API returns a list of up to
                    1000 routing signals available to the
                    organization authenticated with Maskinporten.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>marker</code> parameter is used to
                    indicate the last routing signal you read.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>The very first time</em> you call the API,
                    you should <em>not</em> send
                    any <code>marker</code>. You will then get a
                    list of the first routing signals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each time you have processed a set of routing
                    signals, retrieve the value of
                    the <code>routingResult.id</code> field from the
                    last routing signal in the list and save
                    it.<br/> The next time you call the API, use
                    the value you saved as the <code>marker</code>
                    to get the next set of routing signals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue doing this until you get an empty
                    list. Then there are no more routing signals
                    available for your organization.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Save the last ID you read. To get routing signals
                for consignments on the next transport, use this as
                the <code>marker</code>. This way, you avoid reading
                through all the routing signals for the previous
                transport again.

            <h2 id="kontrollrespons">Routing for Consignments</h2>

            <p>
                The person who presented the consignments, either
                automatically by Norwegian Customs or by
                self-presentation, should use the control routing
                service (movement-routing-api).
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the result from control routing, the actor
                should pick out the consignments that need to be
                physically inspected. These consignments should be
                delivered to the agreed inspection location as soon
                as possible. When an actor requests routing through
                this service, Norwegian Customs will respond with
                one routing per consignment (House Consignment).
            </p>
            <p>
                If the consignment is pre-notified (ICS2), i.e.,
                goods from third countries (outside the EU security
                zone), information about ENS MRN and receptacles
                will be included where relevant. If the consignment
                is not pre-notified, these data elements will be
                empty.
            </p>

            <h2>Who Can Request Routing?</h2>

            <p>
                Business actors involved in submitting messages
                related to the consignment can request a list of
                routings for all consignments they are involved in.
            </p>

            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li>
                    The person who submitted or is mentioned as the
                    customs representative for the transport can get
                    routing for all consignments reported on the
                    transport (the driver, in practice the carrier,
                    is legally responsible).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The person who submitted or is mentioned as the
                    customs representative for the master
                    consignment can get routing for all consignments
                    reported for the master consignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The person who submitted, is mentioned as the
                    customs representative for, or has digitally
                    presented the consignment (house consignment),
                    can get routing for the consignment.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Get Routing?</h2>

            <p>
                When businesses request routing signals for relevant
                consignments, this is done through a call to an
                interface (API) at Norwegian Customs
                (<a href="movement-routing-api.html">Movement
                routing API</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                This interface is independent of the mode of
                transport and will provide routing for all
                consignments reported on all transports that have
                arrived in the customs area and are under processing
                or have been processed by Norwegian Customs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The business actor using this interface
                must <a href="../maskinporten/maskinporten-EN.html">identify
                themselves via Maskinporten</a>. The organization
                number of the business actor determines which
                routings are made available with a call.
            </p>

            <p>
                The URL for routing for consignment is:
            </p>

            <h1>Input Parameters for Using the API</h1>

            <p>
                The interface's (API) input parameter consists of a marker, defined as:
            </p>
            <pre>marker string($uuid)</pre>

            <p>
                This marker determines from which point in the list
                (of routings available for the business actor) the
                response should start. The response from the
                interface will then deliver a list of routings from
                the point the marker indicates and those that are
                newer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interface will show a maximum of 1000 routings
                per call. For more routings, the interface must be
                called multiple times. The first time you call the
                API, it should be called without a marker (to start
                from the beginning), then a marker should always be
                used.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tjenestefremlegging">Service for Presentation</h2>
            <p>
                The service is used for the digital fulfillment of
                the presentation obligation (Customs Act §
                2-4. Presentation of goods for control). The service
                can be used jointly for consignments covered by
                the <strong>reporting and information
                obligation</strong> and/or pre-notified to the EU in
                the ICS2 solution. <br/> Presentation
                (movement-presentation-api) can be reported for
                consignments pre-notified through the two mentioned
                obligations, i.e., consignments expected to be
                presented.
            </p>

            <p>
                Presentation can be done by presenting a master
                consignment, a consignment, or a receptacle
                submitted for the reporting and information
                obligation. If a receptacle or a master consignment
                is presented, all consignments under it will be
                presented. A party presenting consignments (through
                the above API), and not previously connected to the
                consignments, will then be connected and can
                therefore retrieve control routings for the same
                consignments.
            </p>

            <p>
                For pre-notification (ICS2), presentation can be
                done for an entire movement declaration (ENS), a
                receptacle, or individual consignments. If a
                receptacle or a movement declaration is presented,
                all individual consignments under it will be
                presented.
            </p>

            <h2>Routing Signal</h2>

            <p>
                For a consignment, a routing signal will be given:
            </p>
            <pre>routing</pre>
            <p>
                and whether further processing should take place at
                or after the border crossing point:
            </p>
            <pre>routingControlLocation</pre>
            <p>
                along with the identifier as described above.
            </p>

            <p>
                The routing signal (<strong>routing</strong>) can
                have the following values:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>TO_ENTRY</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    This code means that the consignment is given
                    transition to the next customs procedure. This
                    can be, for example, for free disposal or entry
                    into a customs warehouse.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>TO_CONTROL</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    This code means that the consignment is selected
                    for physical control by Norwegian Customs and
                    should be delivered for inspection as soon as
                    possible.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>ENTRY_PENDING</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    This code means that the consignment has
                    deficiencies necessary for transition to the
                    next customs procedure.<br/> The responsible
                    business actor must immediately correct the
                    deviations found so that a new routing can be
                    given. The consignment cannot be released to the
                    recipient.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>ENTRY_DENIED</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    This code means that the consignment is seized
                    by Norwegian Customs and will not be released.
                </dd>
            </dl>


            <p>
                The data element <code>routingControlLocation</code>
                indicates where further processing of the
                consignment should take place. This element
                indicates whether the consignment must be processed
                at the border crossing point or if it is allowed to
                be transported to another location for processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the consignment has a routing signal that
                involves further processing,
                i.e., <strong>TO_CONTROL</strong>
                or <strong>ENTRY_PENDING</strong>, <code>routingControlLocation</code>
                will indicate whether this processing should take
                place at the border crossing point or if the
                consignment can be transported to another location
                (e.g., the actor's sorting facility) for processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Where further processing of the consignment should
                take place (<code>routingControlLocation</code>) can
                have the following values:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>ON_ENTRY</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Processing of the consignment must take place at
                    the border crossing point. This can be at a
                    customs office (on the road) or at a suitable
