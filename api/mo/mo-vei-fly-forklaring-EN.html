        <h2 id="prinsipper">Key Principles</h2>

        <p>
            To understand how presentation and routing work, it is important to understand how the solution handles the
            entire process of goods arriving at the customs area. For arrival, presentation, routing, and entry, the
            solution is based on some key principles:
        </p>

        <div>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically detects the arrival of the means of transport.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically carries out the presentation of consignments based on the
                    reported expected load in the means of transport.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically provides routing signals for the transport and
                    consignments.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Norwegian Customs automatically registers allowed entry to the customs area and initiates
                    the transition to the chosen customs procedure.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            In addition to these key principles, the solution must be able to support exceptions. There are several
            exceptions that lead to deviations from the basic concept in various scenarios:
        </p>
        <ol class="spaced-list">
            <li>Automatic detection of arrival and provision of routing not possible.</li>
            <li>Businesses have received permission, upon application, to present goods at a location other than the
                border crossing point.
            </li>
            <li>In exceptional cases, Norwegian Customs may grant conditional entry pending the completion of document
                control. The relevant goods should remain untouched and stored at an agreed location.
            </li>
            <li>Norwegian Customs decides to physically inspect a consignment at the unloading location or the location
                of presentation instead of the border crossing point.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="gjennomgang">Review of a "standard" process based on the key principles</h2>

        <p>
            For the modes of transportation covered by the Digitoll solution, namely road, train, and air
            transportation, the same main process will apply:
        </p>

        <ol class="spaced-list">
            <li>
                Businesses submit a complete set of messages covering transport, master consignment(s), and house
                consignment(s) for a transport that is set to arrive at the customs area in advance and no later than
                upon arrival.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the means of transportation arrives at the customs area, Norwegian Customs will attempt to
                automatically detect it.
                <ul class="spaced-list">
                    <li>
                        For <em>road</em> transport, this is done through ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) at
                        Ã˜rje and Svinesund, camera 1, or other border crossing solutions (currently under
                        development/testing).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For <em>air</em> transport, this is achieved by using services from Avinor, or manually by
                        customs officers at airports not operated by Avinor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For <em>train</em> transport, the solution is not yet fully defined, but a similar approach as
                        for air transport is assumed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once Norwegian Customs has registered the arrival of the means of transportation, on behalf of the
                sender (in practice, those who have submitted transport, master consignment, and house consignment
                messages), the goods will be digitally presented.
                <ul class="spaced-list">
                    <li>
                        This means that in "normal cases", businesses will not need to perform their own digital
                        presentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other variations will be described separately (see <em><a href="#hvorfor_eget">Why a separate
                        interface (API) for presentation?</a></em>).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Norwegian Customs will then provide routing for the consignments, allowing businesses to access this
                information.
                <ul class="spaced-list">
                    <li>
                        The routing interface is a "pull" interface, where the business identifies itself and receives
                        all routing information for the consignments relevant to the business.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The business that submitted a house consignment message, or is mentioned in the message as the
                        customs representative can retrieve routing for the house consignment(s).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The business that submitted a master consignment message or is mentioned in the message as the
                        customs representative can retrieve routing for all house consignments associated with the
                        master consignment.

                    <li>
                        The business that submitted a transport message or is mentioned in the message as the customs
                        representative can retrieve routing for all consignments associated with all master consignments
                        connected to the transport.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Norwegian Customs will then, at a time depending on the mode of transportation, allow entry to the
                customs area and transition to the chosen customs procedure for all consignments listed in the
                transport.
                <ul class="spaced-list">
                    <li>For air and train transports, this occurs immediately after routing is made available.</li>
                    <li>For road transportation, this happens when the transport leaves the customs area (camera 2).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="fremlegging">Presentation in Digitoll</h2>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, the main principle for presentation is that all goods arriving at the customs area are
            automatically digitally presented by Norwegian Customs on behalf of the carrier of the means of transport.
            The carrier is, as known, in most cases not the one who submits the information. In practice, this means
            that the presentation will be done and the result of the presentation will be made available to the carrier
            (where practically possible) and to those who represent the carrier. This means that for road transport
            carriers, routing will be made available in the form of a light signal. Routing is explained in detail in
            the next section.
        </p>

        <h3 id="hvorfor_eget">Why a separate interface (API) for presentation?</h3>

        <p>
            This interface allows an actor to present consignments digitally on their own initiative. Presentation can
            therefore be done by actors who are not pre-registered in the transport, master consignment, or house
            consignment messages. By presenting consignments digitally, this actor can retrieve routing for the
            presented consignments.
        </p>

        <p>
            The idea here is, for example, a "ground handler" who handles goods arriving by air, where the airline has
            submitted the notification and information data and where the airline itself acts as the customs
            representative. In such a case, this actor ("ground handler") may need to "sign up" to receive information
            so that they can handle the consignments upon arrival.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main rule is that there should be no need to use the presentation interface. This is an interface that
            can be used if needed. If an actor still wants to use the interface, they can do so without causing
            problems.
        </p>

        <p>Submitted <strong>question</strong>:</p>
        <ol class="spaced-list">
            <li>
                <em>At what point should the presentation be used? Is it based on polling, or is there a specific time
                    when data becomes available? Who should use it? Are there criteria for when it should and should not
                    be used? Similarly for routing. Is it such that any party (e.g., the sender of house consignment no.
                    15 on a truck with 100 consignments) should use it, and thus be responsible for the entire truck
                    acting based on the routing information that comes back?</em><br/>
                <em>The information can be interpreted to mean that if a truck is registered through movement-road, it
                    should not be necessary to use the presentation API, because Norwegian Customs has automatically
                    carried out the digital presentation, but the routing API should always be used?</em>
                <ul class="spaced-list" style="margin-top: 20px">
                    <li><strong>Answer</strong>:<br/>
                        As mentioned above, it is not necessary for businesses to submit the presentation. The exception
                        is in very specific cases where the actor needs to retrieve routing without having been involved
                        in the submission of messages in advance.<br/>
                        Regarding routing, it will be necessary for actors who receive consignments/master consignments
                        upon arrival to retrieve routing. This can be at an airport (typically a ground handler), or if
                        the actor has permission to transport consignments from the arrival location to their sorting
                        facility (postal services, express companies).<br/>
                        Other actors may wish to retrieve routing to obtain information they want to use in their
                        logistics flow.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="dirigering">Routing in Digitoll</h2>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, routing will be made available based on automatic arrival and digital presentation.
            Routing will not be available until the transport is registered as arrived. The routing interface is a
            "pull" interface, where the actor identifies themselves and retrieves all routings for consignments relevant
            to the actor. In practice, this means that the interface only has one parameter, a marker, so that the actor
            can retrieve all new routings since the last routing was retrieved. Consignments are retrieved based on who
            identifies themselves in Maskinporten (organization number) and the marker for which routing was last
            retrieved.
        </p>

        <h3 id="hvemhva">Who can retrieve what?</h3>

        <p>
            In principle, it is the sender of the message and any mentioned customs representative (if it is another
            party) who can retrieve routing for consignments. In addition, actors who need it can present consignments
            and thus gain access to routing signals for these.
        </p>

        <ol class="spaced-list">
            <li>The actor who has submitted a message for a consignment, or is mentioned in the message as the customs
                representative, can retrieve routing for this consignment.
            </li>
            <li>The actor who has submitted a message for a master consignment, or is mentioned in the message as the
                customs representative, can retrieve routing for all consignments associated with the master
                consignment.
            </li>
            <li>The actor who has submitted a message for transport, or is mentioned in the message as the customs
                representative, can retrieve routing for all consignments associated with all master consignments
                connected to the transport.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The routing will, for each consignment, contain a reference to the consignment and a routing signal.</p>

        <h2 id="eksempler">Examples</h2>

        <h3 id="Eksempel1">Example 1</h3>
        <div class="example-box">

                and SpeditÃ¸r 1 AS has registered master consignment A and B, while SpeditÃ¸r 2 AS has registered master
                consignment C and D. Norsk Transport AS has ensured that references to all four master consignments are
                included in the transport section.

            In principle, none of these parties should need to submit a presentation message.
            Since this is about road transport, it will, in principle, not be required for any of the actors to retrieve
            routing.

            Norwegian Customs has received a message about this transport and carries out a digital presentation on
            behalf of the carrier (in practice on behalf of Express AS). Routing is immediately made available for 1534
            consignments. 1532 consignments are given transition to the chosen customs procedure, in this case, free
            disposal. One consignment is routed to physical control and one to document control (see <a
                href="#merknadA">note /A/ below</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Express AS uses the routing interface and retrieves routing, thus receiving routing for 1534 consignments.
            Express AS' customs processing department becomes aware that one consignment lacks submitted information.
            The routing information is fed into Express AS' sorting facility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Express AS retrieves the consignments at Gardermoen and drives them to their sorting facility at Helsfyr.
            Meanwhile, the customs department at Express AS has found the missing information for the consignment
            selected for document control and submitted the correct customs information. Norwegian Customs receives and
            processes this information and provides routing for the consignment. Everything is in order, and the
            consignment is granted entry permission and transition to free disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Express AS retrieves routing information and now receives the updated information on the release of the
            consignments that were to document control (see <a href="#merknadA">note /A/ below</a>).
            The updated information is loaded into the sorting facility.
        </p>
        <p>
            The consignments are loaded at the sorting facility as the transport from OSL arrives at Helsfyr 35 minutes
            later. 1533 consignments are sorted for further distribution to Express AS' customers since they are
            released for free disposal. One consignment is sorted for physical control, and Express AS transports this
            to Norwegian Customs for control.

        <p>Note:<br/>
            <a id="merknadA"><strong>/A/</strong></a>
            Document control is not implemented in the solution today but will come within a relatively short time.
            Currently, only the codes TO_ENTRY, TO_CONTROL, ENTRY_DENIED are active.</p>
