        <h2>Messages and Relationships Between Them</h2>

        <h3>Message about Transport</h3>
        <p>
            For each port a vessel calls at, Norwegian Customs will have a transport message.
            This message shall contain information about which port the call concerns ("Port Of Call").
        </p>

        <h3>Message about 'Declaration of goods' (DOG)</h3>
        <p>
            All goods aboard the vessel shall be covered by a "Declaration of Goods" upon arrival at the port.
            This applies to both goods that are to be unloaded in the port the vessel arrives at and goods that are to be unloaded at a subsequent port.
        </p>

        <p>
            For each port the vessel arrives at, new "Declaration of Goods" shall be created for all goods.
            All "Declaration of Goods" shall contain a code for which port the goods covered by "Declaration
            of Goods" are to be unloaded in â†’ "Port Of Discharge"
        </p>
        <p>
            In the port where goods covered by "Declaration of Goods" are to be unloaded, the "Declaration of Goods"
            "Port Of Discharge" will be identical to the transport's (visit) "Port Of Call".
        </p>

        <p><strong>A "Declaration of Goods" can be submitted in different variants:</strong></p>

        <ol class="spaced-list">
            <li>A master consignment with all data and a list of house consignments with all data</li>
            <li>
                A master consignment with all data
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Underlying house consignment will in such cases be sent directly from system suppliers
                        to Digitoll, and it is the consignment that will contain reference to the master consignment.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A list of direct consignments to be unloaded in the same port, where all have all data</li>
            <li>
                A list of references. The references can be:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        A list of references to messages sent directly from system suppliers to Digitoll. There
                        are two separate lists for master consignments and direct consignments respectively
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A list of references to previously submitted master consignments and/or a list of previously
                        submitted direct consignments. There are two separate lists in the message.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Common to both is that the references provided are waybill numbers.
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>
                                The lists can contain combinations of a and b (that is, one can simultaneously refer to
                                messages sent directly to Digitoll with references to messages sent earlier
                                from SSNN)
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            When a "Declaration of Goods" contains a master consignment or direct consignments, with all data, it shall
            not contain lists of references to previously submitted master consignments or direct consignments.
        </p>

        <h3>Message about 'Relationship'</h3>

        <p>
            The linking message, "Relationship", will contain the links between visitID and the various waybill references
            from consignments directly linked to the transport related to a port call.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Waybill numbers for ordinary consignments (House consignment), those that do not have a direct link to
                the transport, shall always be linked to a master consignment and through it to
                the transport. The ordinary consignments will therefore not be included in the relationship message sent
                at each port call.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The relationship message is used by Norwegian Customs to link the various submitted DOG messages with corresponding
            transport message.
        </p>

        <figure>

                 alt="See figure caption"/>
            <figcaption>
                Since all goods aboard are linked to a "Declaration of Goods" that has a "port of discharge",
                Norwegian Customs will be able to find which goods are to be unloaded in which port.

        <h2>Overall Message Flow Regarding Receipts Back to SSNN on Submitted Data</h2>
        <p>Overall message flow:</p>

        <h3>Message about validation-status</h3>
        <p>
            For all submitted messages (transport, DOG and relationship), SSNN will receive synchronous response to submitted
            message. This will contain a requestID.
        </p>

        <p>
            SafeSeaNet must use requestID to retrieve information about whether the submitted message has been processed OK in
            Digitoll. There will be specific endpoints for:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>validation-status for transport</li>
            <li>validation-status for DOG</li>
            <li>validation-status for relationship (probably not shown in GUI in SSNN)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The message structure is common, requestID as parameter when sending message to Digitoll</p>

        <p>The return structure is correspondingly similar, status, possibly MRN if OK, possibly error list if not OK.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Detailed description of message content in validation-status messages is documented in swagger, under
                query-messages:
                <a href="maritime-ssnn-status-api.html">
                    API documentation maritime-ssnn-status-api
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                General information about synchronous validation errors:
                <a href="https://toll.github.io/api/mo/synkrone-valideringsfeil-EN.html">
                    Overview of validation errors for API in
                    Notification/Information
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                General information about asynchronous validation errors:
                <a href="https://toll.github.io/api/mo/asynkrone-valideringsfeil-EN.html">
                    Overview of validation errors for API in MO
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Display of validation-status results in SSNN screens</h3>

        <p>
            Response to transport submission and DOG submission respectively must be displayed in the screens in SSNN, so that one
            can also see the error message and what needs to be corrected.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, it is important that the MRN returned from the transport message is displayed in the screens. The vessel may
            in some cases need to share this with the actors they collaborate with.
