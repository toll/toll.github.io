        <h2 id="funkbesk">Functional description of the service</h2>
        <p>
          The service aims to enable businesses to fulfil their notification and disclosure of
          information obligations digitally. Additionally, the service is designed to automate
          the process as much as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conceptually, the part of the service described here focuses on facilitating the
          submission of information in a way that meets Norwegian Customs' needs for risk
          assessment and control while also enabling automation of other steps.
        </p>

        <p>
          The service allows for the submission of notifications regarding house consignments,
          master consignments, and transport as early as possible and independently of each other.
          However, it is important to note that, at the latest upon crossing the border,
          the entirety of the information submitted to Norwegian Customs must meet the requirements
          for digital notification and disclosure of information obligations.
          <br/>
          This means that the different pieces of information must be interconnected, with keys
          provided by the submitters, and the necessary references must be in place where required.<br/>
          For means of transport other than vehicles on road, crossing the border is considered to be
          when the transport arrives at its destination (e.g airport, port or railroad terminal).
        </p>

        <p>
          The submitter of a notification can submit a notification early,
          update the notification, and withdraw the notification if necessary (post, put, delete).
          <br/>
          The submitter can also request the status of the notification (get).
         </p>

        <p>
          The submitter can submit notifications until the transport reaches the border.
          At the border crossing, the submitted information must be complete for the
          transport, its master consignments, and house consignments.
        </p>

        <p> Information is submitted in three levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Transport, which contain
               <ul>
                    <li> Master Consignments, which contain
                        <ul>
                            <li>House Consignments</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>

            to transport and cargo that needs to be submitted (English text in italics).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 id="infomld">Information and notifications</h3>
        <p>
            The APIs support the submission of information related to digital notification
            and disclosure of information obligations for postal services, express services,
            air freight, road transport vehicles, and ferries in accordance with the
            Movement of Goods Act (Vareførselsloven) §2-3 and associated regulations.

        </p>

        <p> The APIs for submission are divided into three different notifications:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>an API for the submission of information related to Transport </li>
         <li>an API for the submission of information related to Master Consignments</li>
         <li>an API for the submission of information related to House Consignments.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The notifications are submitted separately and independently of each other,
            both in terms of order and sender. The transport notification should include
            a list of tracking numbers for all master consignments that are part of the
            transport upon border crossing.<br/>
            House consignments are associated with master consignments in two different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
            by specifying the master consignment note number in the notification about
            the house consignment. (To be used by all parties other than postal operators)
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="media/MO-nokler-EN.png" alt="Relationship of keys" style="max-width: 60%"></p>
        <p>or</p>
        <ul>
         <li>by referencing the post bag ID in both the house consignment and the master
             consignment. (Only used by postal operators)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="media/MO-nokler-postsekk-EN.png"
                alt=" Relationship between keys using post bag ID" style="max-width: 60%"></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
            For all notifications, there will be a set of data specific to the notification itself and its submission. This data includes information about the customs representative and the identification of the notification (references to the notification itself).

        <p>The tables below provide a complete overview of how to fill
        out a consignment notification based on the customs procedure
        you wish to use when your goods cross the border.</p>

        <p>They also provide an explanation of how to indicate the
        procedure up to the border when necessary. In general, if the
        border crossing occurs by road from Sweden, it is necessary to
        specify the procedure up to the border; otherwise, it is not
        required.</p>

        <h3 id="sekvens">Sequence for submitting notifications</h3>

        <p>
            Generally, the submission of information works in such a way that the
            entity submits a notification (post) and receives a reference (requestId).
            By using the received reference, the entity can inquire (get) about the
            result of the submission and, upon success, receive a permanent reference
            to the notification issued by Norwegian Customs.
            This is done in a separate query API linked further down on this page.
            These services are asynchronous, so queries must be sent until a response
            is received.
            The inquiry is made to the <code>/validation-status</code> endpoint, which will
            return the MRN upon success and a list of validation errors if any exist.<br/>
            The permanent reference is called a Master Reference Number, MRN for short.
            The MRN is used when notifications need to be updated or cancelled (put/delete)
            to refer to previously submitted messages.
        </p>

        <h3 id="kontrolldir">Presentation and control routing</h2>

        <p>
          Norwegian Customs will attempt to automatically detect the arrival of a transport
          at the border. If automatic arrival is detected, Norwegian Customs will carry out
          an automatic digital presentation of all expected consignments on the incoming
          transport.<br/>
          Subsequently, Norwegian Customs will make routing available in our API for the
          expected consignments. Entities connected to the presented consignments will be
          able to retrieve control routing via the API. The entities automatically connected
          are those who submitted information about the consignment in the Norwegian Customs
          API (authenticated in Maskinporten) and customs representatives mentioned in the
          house consignment, master consignment, or transport.
        </p>

            presentation and control routing here</a> (with examples).
        </p>

        <h4 id="tjenestefremlegging">Presentation service</h4>

        <p>
           The service is used for the digital fulfillment of the presentation obligation
           (Movement of Goods Act § 2-3 &ndash; Presentation of goods for control).
           The service can be used jointly for consignments subject to <strong>notification
           and disclosure of information obligations</strong> and/or <strong>pre-notified
           to the EU in the ICS2 solution</strong>.
           <br/>
           Presentation (<strong><a href="movement-presentation-api.html">API:
           movement-presentation</a></strong>)  can be reported for consignments that have
           been pre-notified through the two mentioned obligations, i.e., consignments
           expected to be presented.
        </p>

        <p>
           Presentation can be made by presenting a master consignment, house
           consignment, or a post bag submitted for the notification and disclosure
           of information obligation. If a post bag or a master consignment is presented,
           all consignments under it will be presented. An entity that presents consignments
           (through the aforementioned API), and has not previously been connected to the
           consignments, will then be connected and can therefore retrieve control routing
           for the same consignments.
       </p>

        <p>
           For pre-notification (ICS2), presentation can be made for an entire movement
           declaration (ENS), a post bag, or individual consignments.
           If a post bag or a movement declaration is presented, all individual
           consignments under it will be presented.
        </p>

        <h4 id="kontrollrespons">Common routing of house consignments</h4>
        <p>for ICS2 and Notification and Disclosure of Information</p>

        <p>
          House consignments that are digitally fulfilled for ICS2 and notification
          and disclosure of information will get a common routing. When the transport
          that the house consignment is transported by has arrived in the customs area,
          routing will automatically be made available.
        </p>

        <h5>Who can ask for routing?</h5>

        <p>
          The parties that have been involved in the digital fulfillment for the house
          consignment can ask for a list of routings for all the house consignments they
          are involved with.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The party that fulfilled or is an agent for the transport
            information can get routing for all house consignment that is transported
            by the transport
          </li>
          <li>
            The party that fulfilled or is an agent for the master
            consignment information can get routing for all house consignment that is
            contained within the master consignment
          </li>
          <li>
            The party that fulfilled, is an agent for, or has
            digitally presented the house consignment can get routing for the house
            consignment
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How to obtain routing?</h5>

        <p>
          To obtain routing for house consignments, the party concerned must call an
          API at Norwegian Customs (<a href="movement-routing-api.html">movement
          routing API</a>). This API is independent from the type
          of transport. All routing results for all types of transportation will be
          returned. Our APIs <a href="maskinporten-EN.html">use
          Maskinporten</a> for identity and access management. It is the Norwegian
          organization number for the party accessing the API that determines which
          routings are made available.
        </p>

        <p>
          URLs for house consignments routings are:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>PLAYGROUND:</dt>
            <dd><a href="https://api-test.toll.no/api/movement/routing/v1/house-consignment">https://api-test.toll.no/api/movement/routing/v1/house-consignment</a>

          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h5>Inputparameter (API)</h5>

        <p>
          API input parameter is defined as a marker:
        </p>
        <pre>marker string($uuid)</pre>

        <p>
          This marker defines where in the feed of routings (for the party) the
          response will start. The response will deliver a list of routing from the
          position of the marker and forward (newer routings).<br/>
          The API will return a list of a maximum of 1000 routings at a time. When there
          are more routings, the API must be called repeatedly until the list is empty.
          The very first time this API is called, no marker should be used, to make sure
          the list starts at the beginning.
        </p>

        <h5>Response (API)</h5>

        <p>
          The response from the API consists of data elements that identifies the
          house consignment, a routing signal and an identifier. The identifier from the
          last fetched routing is used as the marker for the next call on the API.
        </p>

        <h5>Identifying data elements</h5>

        <p>
          The identifying data elements for the house consignments are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><code>referenceNumber</code></dt>
          <dd>
            This is the transport document number used as the identifier for the house
            consignment.
          </dd>
          <dt><code>type</code></dt>
          <dd>
            The type transport document number used (<a
            href="mo-kodeverk-EN.html#cl754">code set CL754</a>)
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          Additionally there can be two more identifying
          data elements:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><code>entrySummaryDeclarationMRN</code></dt>
          <dd>MRN from ICS2</dd>
          <dt><code>receptacleId</code></dt>
          <dd>Identifier for receptacle for postal house consignment</dd>
        </dl>

        <h5>Routing</h5>

        <p>
          For the house consignment there will be one routing:
        </p>
        <pre>routing</pre>
        <p>
          and, if any further actions should be performed when or after border
          crossing:
        </p>
        <pre>routingControlLocation</pre>

        <p>
          The <strong>routing</strong> can have the following values:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>TO_ENTRY</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This code signifies that the house consignment has been released to
            the next customs procedure.
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>TO_CONTROL</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This code signifies that Norwegian Customs requires a physical
            control of the house consignment.
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>ENTRY_PENDING</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This code signifies that the house consignment does not meet the requirements
            for release to the next customs procedure. The responsible party must rectify
            the discrepancy as soon as possible, to make it possible to issue a new
            routing. The house consignment cannot be delivered to the consignee.
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>ENTRY_DENIED</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            This code signifies that the house consignment is seized by the Norwegian
            Customs.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          The data element <strong>routingControlLocation</strong> describes at which
          location the house consignment should be processed (either at the location
          of entry or a location after entry). If the house consignment has a
          routing that require further processing (<strong>TO_CONTROL</strong> or
          <strong>ENTRY_PENDING</strong>), the <strong>routingControlLocation</strong>
          will specify whether this processing must be performed at the point of entry
          or if the house consignment may be transferred to another location,
          such as the party's terminal or sorting facility for processing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data element <strong>routingControlLocation</strong> may have the
          following values:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>ON_ENTRY</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            Further processing for the house consignment must be conducted at
            the point of entry. This might be at a customs border crossing
            (road), at an airport (air freight, ground handler), in a harbour
            (port agent) or at a rail terminal (rail operator).
          </dd>
          <dt><strong>AFTER_ENTRY</strong></dt>
          <dd>
            Further processing for the house consignment may be transferred to another
            location, such as the party's terminal or sorting facility for
            processing.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          If a house consignment should receive multiple routings, it is always
          the <em>latest</em> routing that is applicable. For example, it is
          possible for a house consignment to get routing
          <strong>ENTRY_PENDING</strong>, and then later receive routing
          <strong>TO_CONTROL </strong>or <strong>TO_ENTRY</strong>. If a party
          does not receive routing for a house consignment that is digitally
          fulfilled, this is normally caused by Norwegian Customs not having had
          the required time to process the house consignment. The party must
          then withhold the house consignment until a valid routing is obtained.

        <p>
            The API for control routing works by continously publishing a routing signal for
            consignments that are presented.
            Normally, presentation will happen automatically when the transport arrives at the border, but it may also
            be triggered by a call to the presentation API
            (<a href="#movement-presentation-api">movement-presentation-api</a>).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each call to the API returns a list of up to 1000 available  routing signals
                for the organisation authenticated via Maskinporten.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parameter <code>marker</code> denotes the ID of the last routing signal you read.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>The very first time</em> you call the API, <em>no </em><code>marker</code> is used.
                You will then get a list of the <em>first</em> routing signals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each time one set of signals has been processed, store the value of
                <code>routingResult.id</code> from the last item in the list.<br/>
                For the next API call, use that value as the <code>marker</code>, you will then get the
                next routing signals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep doing this until an empty list is returned. Then there are currently no more available
                routing signals for your organisation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Store the last read id, and use that as the <code>marker</code> the next time you start
            a call sequence, then you won't have to scan past the routing signals for previous transports.
        </p>

        <h3 id="dokumentinnsending">API: Document upload</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to the information about consignments provided through the movement APIs,
            it is also possible to upload invoices and other documentation for consignments where customs declarations
            have already been submitted. Documentation for this API can be found here:
            <a href="document-api-EN.html">Document upload API</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="eksempler">Examples</h2>
        <p>
            We have created a brief overview of how the notification content for consignments
            can look, based on the customs procedure used.
            <a href="mo-eksempler-EN.html">Examples can be found here</a>.<br/>
            On the same page, there is also information about test data related to customs declarations
            that can be used for testing the interface.
        </p>

        <h2 id="autentisering">Authentication &ndash;
        Data exchange between the business sector and Norwegian Customs</h2>
        <p>
            Our APIs use Maskinporten for identity and access management.
            On the page <strong><a href="maskinporten-EN.html">Maskinporten</a>
            </strong>you will find information on:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>how to get started with integration via Maskinporten including a registration form
             for access to Norwegian Customs</li>
         <li>access management for our APIs</li>
         <li>setting up a client for authentication via Maskinporten</li>
         <li>operations and monitoring/troubleshooting.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> The scope used for the APIs is documented for each individual API.</p>
